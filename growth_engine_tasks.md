# Growth Engine Task List

- Implement micro-communities with Niche Finder onboarding and problem-solving thread templates.
- Build partner growth loops: collab posts, pinned shoutouts, Value Trade board, and cross-platform profile linking.
- Add engagement gamification: badges, XP, starter comment recognition, and weekly Top Human leaderboard with cross-post rewards.
- Develop weekly content builder with templates for carousels, threads, and shorts plus smart pinning and one-click cross-posting.
- Schedule background jobs for leaderboards, collab suggestions, and multi-platform pushes while logging engagement metrics.
- Expose API hooks so external networks can import or share content directly from the app.
